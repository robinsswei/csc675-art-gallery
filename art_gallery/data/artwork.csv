The Starry Night,100000,1889,"Van Gogh depicted the view at different times of day and under various weather conditions, including sunrise, moonrise, sunshine-filled days, overcast days, windy days, and one day with rain. The hospital staff did not allow Van Gogh to paint in his bedroom, but he was able to make sketches in ink or charcoal on paper, and eventually he would base newer variations on previous versions. The pictorial element uniting all of these paintings is the diagonal line coming in from the right depicting the low rolling hills of the Alpilles mountains. In fifteen of the twenty-one versions, cypress trees are visible beyond the far wall enclosing the wheat field. Van Gogh telescoped the view in six of these paintings, most notably in F717 Wheat Field with Cypresses and The Starry Night, bringing the trees closer to the picture plane.", ,1,Painting,"29"" x 36 1/4"" ",yes,1,Oil on canvas,1,1,1
"Invisible Lion, Horse, Sleeping Woman",780000,1930,"This analytical work is one of the first painted in the new house in Port Lligat during the summer of 1930. In his numerous written works Dali has given us much information about this picture. ""A month after my return from Paris,"" he writes, ""I signed a contract with George Keller and Pierre Colle. Shortly after in the tatter's gallery I exhibited my Invisible Sleeping Woman, Horse, Lion, fruit of my contemplation at Cape Creus."" The Viscount of Noailles bought this oil.

Adélaïde Labille-Guiard des Vertus, was a French miniaturist and portrait painter. She first exhibited her art in 1774 at the Académie de Saint-Luc's Salon. After that exhibition, Labille-Guiard's works would often be compared against those of Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun, one of Labille-Guiard's contemporaries and a fellow member of the Académie de Saint-Luc. This show was so successful that the Royal Academy took offense, and with the backing of the monarchy, issued an edict in March 1776 abolishing ""guilds, brotherhoods, and communities of arts and crafts"".

Initially, it was known as the Poet and was part of a directive by Musée des Arts Décoratifs, Paris to shape an epic portal to be used as the museum gateway. Named The Gates of Hell, all the statutes originated from The Divine Comedy of Dante. The Thinker, made from bronze, finally presented itself in a miniature on top of the Gates of Hell pondering the fate of those beneath him, which is different from Rodin's original idea of depicting Dante reflecting over his poem in front of the Gates.

Beethoven Frieze,77777,1901,"The frieze illustrates human desire for happiness in a suffering and tempestuous world in which one contends not only with external evil forces but also with internal weaknesses. The viewer follows this journey of discovery in a stunning visual and linear fashion. It begins gently with the floating female Genii searching the Earth but soon follows the dark, sinister-looking storm-wind giant, Typhoeus, his three Gorgon daughters and images representing sickness, madness, death, lust and wantonness above and to the right. Thence appears the knight in shining armour who offers hope due to his own ambition and sympathy for the pleading, suffering humans. The journey ends in the discovery of joy by means of the arts and contentment is represented in the close embrace of a kiss. Thus, the frieze expounds psychological human yearning, ultimately satisfied through individual and communal searching and the beauty of the arts coupled with love and companionship.", ,1,Sculpture,7' x 112',yes,1,Polychrome Sculpture,11,11,11

Cleopas wears the scallopshell of a pilgrim. The other apostle wears torn clothes. Cleopas gesticulates in a perspectively-challenging extension of arms in and out of the frame of reference. The standing groom, forehead smooth and face in darkness, appears oblivious to the event. The painting is unusual for the life-sized figures, the dark and blank background.

The Child's Bath,0,1893,"In 1893, Mary Cassatt created the oil painting with two subjects, a mother figure and a young child. The genre scene is based on the everyday bathing of a child, a moment that is “special by not being special”. [4] The female figure holds up the child firmly and protectively with her left hand while the other hand carefully washes the child’s feet. The small and chubby left arm of the child braces against the mother’s thigh, while the other hand is clamped firmly on the child’s own thigh. The mother’s right hand presses firmly but still gently on the foot in the basin, mimicking the child’s own pressure on her thigh. To indicate depth, Cassatt painted the faces to recede into space. The paint strokes are layered and rough, creating thick lines that outline the figures and stand them out from the patterned background. The hand of the artist is evident through the roughness of the strokes and can be better viewed from a distance.", ,1,Painting,"39.5"" × 26""",yes,1,Oil on canvas,22,22,22

A wide range of well detailed palaces, churches, an island, a towered bridge, hills and fields is portrayed, subject to a uniform light. Perhaps some of the Chancellor's many landholdings around Autun are included in the vista. A haze covers a mountain range in the far distance.
